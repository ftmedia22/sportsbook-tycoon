# Sportsbook Syndicate Tycoon – Dev Docs v2.0

Developer-focused documentation set for AI-assisted coding and implementation.

## Top-Level Structure

- `high_level/` – Concept, core loop, meta, product requirements
- `systems/` – Gameplay systems by feature (sports, analysts, bettors, risk, missions, economy)
- `ai_math/` – Math, odds, bettor AI behavior
- `ui_ux/` – Screens, flows, wireframes
- `backend/` – Architecture, services, APIs, data models
- `narrative/` – Narrative system + arc categories
- `production/` – Roadmap, QA/telemetry, pitch, branding, competition

Each file is intentionally scoped so an AI assistant can load 1–3 files and produce code or content for that area without being overwhelmed.
